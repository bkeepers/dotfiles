# This script encapsulates my process for keeping up with Twitter:
#
# 1. Create a private list called Signal, add everyone you currently follow to
#    it, and begin curating it.
# 2. Follow everyone you meet or find interesting.
# 3. Create a private list called Noise, containing everyone you follow that are
#    not in Signal.
# 4. Use Signal as your timeline in tweetbot. Switch to Noise when you are bored
#    or are looking for inspiration.
#
# Dependencies:
# - `gem install t`
